Finish Line!!

Congratulations! You have built your first functional dApp on Tezos! If you are interested in a visual tutorial on the dApp and deployment, visit the Zastrin course on Tezos https://www.zastrin.com/ which this segment was based on.

The next and final section of Tezos Capstone, SECTION 3, will be formally released at the beginning of March 2019. In this section, you will build your own dApp in a competition against other Tezos Capstone participants. Top dApps will be recognized, and will be rewarded travel stipends for the Tezos Hackathon in New York Fall 2019. There is no theme, so feel free to build your dream dApp on Tezos! More details will be released in March!

If you have technical questions or Tezos questions in general, visit the new Tezos stack exchange here: https://tezos.stackexchange.com/users/login?ssrc=beta
